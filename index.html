            <h3>Serbia, country of rivers, hills and champions</h3>
            <p>
              Serbia is a country blessed with an abundance of rivers and lakes,
              which provide ideal opportunities for holiday travel and
              recreation and are also perfect for cooling down during the hot
              summer months. Serbia boasts five national parks: Fruška Gora,
              Đerdap Gorge/Iron Gate, Tara, Kopaonik and Šar Mountain. In the
              national parks, you can set out on a quest to find some of the
              most endangered species of flora and fauna, enjoy breath-taking
              views or collect medicinal wild herbs and mushrooms.
